        Fetching means loading data from the db. Lazy means only load the User if someone asks for it, so dont load it
        right away. Lazy is used because say we have 1000 notes, if every note automatically loaded owner, permissions,
        etc. you'd get tons of data you may never use. Lazy avoids that -- leads to less data, less memory, faster queries,
        more control.
